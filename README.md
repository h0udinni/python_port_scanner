<h1 align="center"> 💻Port Scanner Script💻 </h1>

Description: A Python script that automates the scanning of open network ports on a host. It can scan IPv4 addresses from local hosts and the Internet (e.g., google.com).

## ⚙️ | Main Features

- `Interactive Interface`: A text-based interface that allows users to navigate the program using menu options.
- `Displaying Information about IPv4 and Common Ports`: Provides information about the IPv4 address format and lists frequently used ports, such as 20, 21, 22, 80, etc.
- `Scanning Local Ports or a Specific IP`: Enables users to scan for open ports on the local host or a specified IP address.
- `Scanning Known Ports`: Checks a predefined list of commonly used ports (e.g., 20, 21, 22, 80, 443) to identify which are open on the host.
- `Scanning All Ports`: Performs a scan of all 65,535 possible ports on the host to detect any that are open.
- `Scanning User-Selected Ports`: Allows users to manually specify a list of ports to scan.

## 📖 | What did I learn?

- **Fundamentals of Networks:**
  - Practical application of IPv4 addresses (octets and values);
  - Which ports can be a major vulnerability to the network, becoming an entry point for attacks;
  
- **Use of Python Libraries:**
  - **socket:**
    - The library can be used to establish TCP/IP connections and even open a local server.
  - **os:**
    - Execution of commands in the operating system.
  - **ipaddress:**
    - Application of IP addresses in Python.
  
- **Structured Programming:**
  - Separation of different functions and files for resource optimization;
  - Use of libraries for resource optimization;
  - Input validation with try/except;
  - Closing socket connections to avoid performance issues;
  
- **Security Scanning for Open Ports Identification;**

### Conlusion:
The project helped me a lot in practicing problem-solving, programming logic, and code structuring.
